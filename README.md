## Introduction

FrameFinder is a comprehensive pipeline that leverages cutting-edge deep learning models to perform complex image analysis tasks. By integrating advanced techniques in computer vision and natural language processing, FrameFinder is capable of detecting objects, extracting text, and summarizing visual content efficiently and accurately.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 to detect and annotate objects within an image.
- **Text Extraction**: Utilizes EasyOCR, built with powerful foundation models, to accurately extract text from detected regions.
- **Object Summarization**: Applies FuseCap, a vision transformer-based model, to generate summaries for each detected object.

## Installation

To install FrameFinder, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/framefinder.git
   cd framefinder
